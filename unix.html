This is a brief tutorial on how to setup your personal Linux Ubuntu system to be ready for the COMS10016 unit. 
The below steps represent one out of many ways of setting up your system for the unit. Many of the steps can be shortened 
and they are outlined as is for clarity. Before you start make sure your system is up-to-date with respect to updates and features. 
It is your responsibility to keep your personal system and passwords safe.

<h2>INSTALL THE CLANG COMPILER</h2>
<ul>
<li>right-click on the desktop and click on "Open Terminal", a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "sudo apt update", then press enter and the update process will begin</li>
<li>if asked, enter the administrator password</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, type "sudo apt-get install clang", then press enter and the installation will begin</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, the clang compiler should be installed</li>
<li>type "exit" and press enter to close the Linux terminal window</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTALL THE ATOM EDITOR</h2>
<ul>
<li>right-click on the desktop and click on "Open Terminal", a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom", then press enter and the update process will begin</li>
<li>if asked, enter the administrator password</li>
<li>type "sudo apt update", then press enter and the update process will begin</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, type "sudo apt-get install atom", then press enter and the installation will begin</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, the atom editor should be installed</li>
<li>type "exit" and press enter to close the Linux terminal window</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTALL HASKELL AND QUICKCHECK</h2>
<ul>
<li>right-click on the desktop and click on "Open Terminal", a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh", then press enter and the update process will begin</li><hr/>
<li>Note: you will be asked for your root password for sudo purposes (approx. 2 times)</li>
<li>Note: after the installation, you may need to add "~/.local/bin" to your PATH variable. You can do this with the following terminal command: "PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin"</li>
<li>Note: if you out of disk space, try deleting ".stack". This is a hidden file that you can see using "ls -a", and delete using "rm -fr .stack"</li>
<li>Note: if you have any further installation issues, try checking these <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/" target="_blank">FAQs</a>. The Teaching Assistants (TAs) will be there in the first lab to help you with this in the setup labs.</li>
<hr/>
<li>after a successful installation, you can run the Haskell GHCi interpreter by typing "stack ghci" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can run the Haskell GHCi interpreter with the QuickCheck package by typing "stack ghci --package QuickCheck" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can interpret Haskell files (such as a file "File.hs") by adding the file as a final argument to your stack command like "stack ghci --package QuickCheck File.hs" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<li>after a successful installation, you can compile Haskell files (such as a file "File.hs") by adding the file as a final argument to your stack command like "stack ghc --package QuickCheck File.hs" in the terminal and pressing enter</li>
<hr/>
<li>Note: once you verify that GHCi is running, you can use the :q command to exit it and go back to the command prompt.</li>
<hr/>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If the Haskell installation does not work for you then hold on and use the setup labs during week 1 to get help from a TA. 
Only if after asking TAs for help you have not been able to install Haskell successfully, then consider looking into more complicated <a href="haskellextra.html" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
</ul>

At this point your system is ready for most of the COMS10016 unit and you are ready to start programming in C and Haskell. Further installations
are optional at the beginning of the unit. However, during the last part of the unit we will use graphics, and for this we will need the SDL2 graphics libraries 
and a Linux desktop environment...

<h2>INSTALL THE SDL2 DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE</h2>
<ul>
<li>right-click on the desktop and click on "Open Terminal", a Linux terminal window will open</li>
<li>type "sudo apt update", then press enter and the update process will begin</li>
<li>if asked, enter the administrator password</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, type "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev", then press enter and the installation will begin</li>
<li>in case you are queried about disk usage during the installation type "Y" and press enter to confirm</li>
<li>once ready, the SDL2 library should be installed</li>
<li>type "exit" and press enter to close the Linux terminal window</li>
</ul>

<h2>CHECK SDL2 GRAPHICS</h2>
<ul>
<li>download the program <a href="hellosdl.c" target="_blank">hellosdl.c</a></li>
<li>compile the program, for instance via "clang -std=c11 -Wall hellosdl.c -lSDL2 -o hellosdl", where the 'l' in -lSDL2 stands for link</li>
<li>if this did not work try compilation via "clang -std=c11 -Wall hellosdl.c -I/usr/include/SDL2 -lSDL2 -o hellosdl"</li>
<li>run the program, for instance via "./hellosdl" - if you see a sky blue window appear then SDL2 is working properly</li>
<li>note that some ports of the SDL library unfortunately have memory leaks, which may be reported back to the terminal...you have to live with it</li>
</ul>
